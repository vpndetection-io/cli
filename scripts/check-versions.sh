# Refuses a release whose version strings do not all agree with the tag.
#
#   ./scripts/check-versions.sh 0.2.2
#
# `main.go` is the version of record. Everything else checked here is a COPY of
# it that a release silently invalidates: the installer scripts hand out a
# download URL built from their own default, so a stale one keeps serving the
# PREVIOUS release forever, and it works - which is why nobody notices.
#
# Deliberately NOT checked. Each is a template a build step substitutes, and a
# gate that flags a template is a gate someone switches off:
#   dist/DEBIAN/control            Version: 0.0.0   <- scripts/build-archive-all.sh
#   chocolatey-packages/*.nuspec   <version>0.0.0   <- scripts/update-chocolatey.ps1
#   homebrew/vpndetection.rb.tmpl  @VSN@            <- scripts/update-homebrew.sh
#   Dockerfile                     ARG VERSION=dev  <- --build-arg, release.yml
